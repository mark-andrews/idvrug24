The required software for this workshop is all free and open source
and will run identically on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms.

There are a few pieces of software to install:

-   [R](https://www.r-project.org/): An environment for statistical
    computing.
-   [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/): An integrated development
    environment for using R.
-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): A bundle of R packages to
    use R the modern way, and including `ggplot2`.
-   Additional packages to work with `ggplot2`


## Installing R

Go to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) website and follow the links
for downloading. On Windows, this should lead you to

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>.

Downloading this and following the usual Windows installation process,
you\'ll then have a full working version of R.

On Macs, the installation procedure is essentially identical. The latest
Mac installer should be available at

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>.

Download this and follow the usual Mac installation process to get a
full working version of R for Macs.

## Installing Rstudio

Using Rstudio is not strictly necessary. You can do all you need to do
with R without using Rstudio. However, many people have found that using
R is more convenient and pleasant when working through Rstudio. To
install it, go to the [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website,
specifically to

-   <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>

which will list all the available installers. Note that you just want
the Rstudio *desktop* program. The Rstudio *server* is something else
(basically it is for providing remote access to Rstudio hosted on Linux
servers).

Again, you\'ll just follow the usual installation process for Windows or
Macs to install Rstudio using these installers.

## Installing the tidyverse packages

The so-called [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of
interrelated R packages that implement essentially a new standard
library for R.
All the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages
can be installed by typing the following command in R:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The main packages that are contained within the[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) bundle are listed [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).

## Additional packages

We will also use a few other packages for extra features when doing data visualization.
These can be installed as follows:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "cowplot", "ggExtra", "ggthemes", "ggrepel"))
```
